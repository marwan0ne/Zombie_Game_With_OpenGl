General idea:

A zombie game consists of 3 characters, the first character is the main character, he has a gun with which he fights the two characters, the third character is huge, and appears in the end after fighting the second character .
The first character shoots the second character In the event that the first character is able to kill the second character, the total points of the first character will increase and he moves to the last stage, which is to fight the last character.
If the first character wins the game, the cic logo will appear, and if he doesn't win, it will show that the game is over
If the second character shoots the first character  the total points will start decreasing, he will die and the game will start again.



The requirements:
The player: the player must appear in a fixed position and free to move to either
up or down or left or right through using keyboard or mouse functions.
The power-ups:
Power-ups will drop randomly, and each character you take will add a number to his score.
When the player hits the power-up, the power-up must disappear.
The score:
 It must be displayed on the screen.
 The score increases when the player collects the Power-ups.

The Protection from gunshots:
The second and third characters will defend themselves from gunshots, either by using a protective shield or by moving left and right or a wall that appears and disappears
